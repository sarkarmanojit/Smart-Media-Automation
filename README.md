# Smart Media Automation

This project contains Python tools to help automate media organization tasks — from sorting photos by emotion or date, to packaging ebooks with metadata and custom covers.

## Features
- 📸 EXIF-based photo sorting
- 🎬 Movie dashboards with genre & rating grouping
- 📚 EPUB packaging with metadata and cover design
- 🛡️ Safety-first: dry-run modes, hash checks, and logging

## Why I Built This
As a creative and technical learner, I wanted tools that blend automation with personal meaning. These scripts help me organize my media efficiently — and I hope they help you too.

## Getting Started
Each folder contains a README with usage instructions. You’ll need Python 3.9+ and a few basic libraries (listed in each module).
